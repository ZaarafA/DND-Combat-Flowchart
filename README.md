### D&D Combat can get confusing. <br> 

Drawing out a flowchart lets you see what you can do at a glance, ensuring speedy turns and unforgotten Bonus Actions.
This program takes a D&DBeyond Character Sheet PDF and generates a combat flowchart. Users can edit and save the flowchart as a quick reference guide. 

<hr> 

### How to Use:
- Upload a PDF Character Sheet from D&D Beyond
- Left-click on a node to edit the flowchart
  - Add, Edit, or Delete a node. 
- Click on "SAVE PNG" to save the flowchart as an image.

#### Note: This is still a Work in Progress. Bugs are surely lurking out of sight.
